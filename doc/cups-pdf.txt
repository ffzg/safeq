We are using cups-pdf to create printer which is shared on windows using ipp.

Since we are not getting users from windows in our setup, we need cups-pdf
PostProcessing hook to look find user from pGinaSessions.


sudo vi /etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf

PostProcessing /srv/safeq/cups-pdf-find-owner.sh



To make this work, you also have to edit apparmor:

sudo vi /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.cupsd

edit end of file, under /usr/lib/cups/backend/cups-pdf {
add permission for script execution:
...
  /var/spool/cups/** r,
  /var/spool/cups-pdf/** rw,

  # safeq ffzg -- added to allow execution of PostProcessing
  /srv/safeq/cups-pdf-find-owner.sh uxr,
}



Replace apparmor roule with updated:

apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.cupsd

Or reload all roules:

/etc/init.d/apparmor restart



This script will use bash to trigger socket connection with params to
real implementation which has to wait for a while for cups control file
to appear since we need it to extract IP address of client machine.
Another problem is that PostProcessing directive is run as nobody
and we need root permissions to read control files, so we need to run
daemon part via sudo:

sudo ./cups-pdf-find-owner.pl

(since suidperl is no longer a thing)
