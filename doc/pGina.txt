We are using pGina to login into windows using LDAP server. However, since we are using single account on
windows for all users (to decrease time needed for login since windows would create new account for 10
minutes) we need to somehow know real user id so we are using pGina mysql logger plugin.

sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

sudo vi /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf	# modify bind-address if needed

sudo systemctl restart mariadb

sudo mysql

MariaDB [(none)]> create user 'pGina'@'%' identified by 'secret' ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> create database pGinaDB ;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.000 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> grant all on pGinaDB.* to pGina ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)

Now enable all required options in pgina and create tables.
