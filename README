Goal is to write replacement SafeQ using cups and samba

For now, first goal is to support SafeQ terminal protocol so we can re-use devices not supported
by vendor any more. We are also annoyed by SafeQ "feature" which doesn't allow us to use scanning
if Xerox runs out of toner. This is arbitrary limitation which cripples this setup for us.


./debian-install.sh		# will install required Debian packages


We have old Xerox WorkCentre 5225 and 7232 machines (from 2008) and getting active jobs or
history is supported by web interface which is scraped and javascript variables inside
used to display info.

./xwc-jobs.pl 10.60.3.35		# list active jobs on Xerox WorkCentre 5225 by scraping web
./xwc-jobs.pl 10.60.3.35 list

./xwc-jobs.pl 10.60.3.35 hist	# list completed jobs

Script produces tab delimited output, but if you want to format it nicely you can always use
SEP enviroment variable to specify sparator and column to format it. This is included in
xwc-jobs helper shell script which is useful for interactive use:

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ ./xwc-jobs 10.60.3.35
IP          id        Job Name   Owner       Status         Type     Quantity
10.60.3.35  00015c2c  -          10.60.3.10  3:User Action  1:Print  0
10.60.3.35  00015c2f  Test Page  root        3:User Action  1:Print  0
10.60.3.35  00015c32  -          10.60.3.10  3:User Action  1:Print  0


You can delete job using:

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ curl -XPOST -d OPR=CANCEL -d JOBS=00015c32/ http://10.60.3.35/JOBCTRL.cmd

or use d[elete] or c[ancel] aruguments and job id(s):

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ ./xwc-jobs 10.60.3.35 d 00015c41
10.60.3.35  00015c41  CANCEL  REQUEST: ACCEPTED


When sending jobs via lpr to Xerox using ipp configured in cups we see -T as job name and -U as owner:

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ ./xwc-jobs
IP          id        Job Name  Owner  Status         Type     Quantity
10.60.3.35  00015c47  lpr-T     lpr-U  3:User Action  1:Print  0

When sending jobs directly to printer using rlpr we see different flags:

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ rlpr -H 10.60.3.35 -U lpr-U -P XWC5225-5KatL -C lpr-C -J lpr-J -T lpr-T /usr/share/doc/printer-driver-foo2zjs/manual.pdf

dpavlin@t42:~/safeq$ ./xwc-jobs                                                                                        IP          id        Job Name  Owner       Status         Type     Quantity
10.60.3.35  00015c50  lpr-J     lpr-U       3:User Action  1:Print  0
